### Hi there, I am Juan Castro

I started this small software development company named Jempe. and I've been working remotely for different companies since 2006. I am passionate about coding since I had my first computer, so when I am not working for clients I am working on my personal software projects. I think of coding like an art. I love the stuff I create and I try to perfect and polish everything I create. I just feel that sometimes I don't have enough time to do it.

I am a full stack developer but I've focused on A/B Testing since 2014. I've created hundreds of A/B tests for a lot of e-commerce websites using tools like **VWO, Optimizely, Google optimize, Google Tag Manager and Tealium** 

## I offer the following Services:

**A/B Test Development**
Shopify themes customization
Bigcommerce themes customization
Web Development
Mobile apps Development (iOs and Android)

This repository is a collection of open source projects, and tools I found useful on my daily professional life.

## Programming Languages
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Golang
PHP
