### Hi there, I am JC

I have been working remotely for different companies since 2006. My passion for coding started with my first computer, and it has only grown since. When I'm not working for clients, I dedicate my time to personal software projects, treating coding as an art form. I strive to perfect and polish every creation, though I often wish for more time to refine them further.

As a full-stack developer, I have focused on **A/B Testing** since 2014, crafting hundreds of experiments for e-commerce websites using tools like VWO, Optimizely, Google Optimize, Google Tag Manager, and Tealium.

I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and prioritize simplicity and security in my work. **Golang** is my favorite language, and I prefer **Vanilla JavaScript** over frameworks for its flexibility and control. I actively avoid unnecessary dependencies to ensure easier maintenance and better software security.

## I offer the following Services:

* **A/B Test Development**
* Shopify themes customization
* Bigcommerce themes customization
* Web Development
* Mobile apps Development (iOs and Android)

## Programming Languages
* Golang
* Javascript
* PHP

If you are interested in hiring me, please send me an email to <a href="contact@jempe.org">contact@jempe.org<a>.
