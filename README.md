### Hi there, I am JC

I founded a small software development company named **Jempe**, and I've been working remotely for different companies since 2006. I am passionate about coding since I had my first computer, so when I am not working for clients I am working on my personal software projects. I think of coding like an art. I love the stuff I create and I try to perfect and polish every creation. I just feel that sometimes I don't have enough time to do it.

I am a full stack developer but I've focused on A/B Testing since 2014. I've created hundreds of A/B tests for a lot of e-commerce websites using tools like **VWO, Optimizely, Google optimize, Google Tag Manager and Tealium** 

## I offer the following Services:

* **A/B Test Development**
* Shopify themes customization
* Bigcommerce themes customization
* Web Development
* Mobile apps Development (iOs and Android)

## Programming Languages
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Golang
* PHP

If you are interested in hiring me, please send me an email to <a href="contact@jempe.org">contact@jempe.org<a>.
